        "Let us try bootstraping, which says that instead of taking whole dataset for training we take only a few rows(subset with replacement ) and train each  tree, and in such a way we have different trees and we can get better Random Forest Model\n",
        "\n",
        "Since we are using only subset of data to train each tree, thus remaining rows act as validation set for that tree, thus each tree has its validation set, and we can have OBB score in case of bootstrap is true\n",

        "How OBB score is calculated is as follows, for each row, let us say row A, we see, in whose validation set this row A falls and all those trees predict the value of row A, and we take the average of all these predictions as final prediction of row A.\n",
